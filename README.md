Web Series Analysis Dashboard
This is my first data visualization project using Excel.
I used a web series dataset from Kaggle because I enjoy watching web series, and I wanted to analyze trends such as ratings, genres, popularity, and the number of shows released over time.
This project helped me understand how to clean data, use pivot tables, create charts, and design an interactive dashboard.

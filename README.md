 Web Series Analysis Dashboard

This is my first data visualization project using Microsoft Excel.
I used a web series dataset from Kaggle because I enjoy watching web series and wanted to analyze trends such as ratings, genres, popularity, and the number of shows released over time.

This project helped me learn how to clean data, use pivot tables, create charts, apply slicers, and design an interactive dashboard.
